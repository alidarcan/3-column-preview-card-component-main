## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
<!--   - Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
-->

### What I learned

I practised HTML and CSS. 
I learned a little about creating flexbox. (I am still learning)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.learn1 {
  -webkit-border-radius: 28;
  -moz-border-radius: 28;
  border-radius: 28px;
  background: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 12px 28px 12px 28px;
  border: solid #f2f2f2 3px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
}

.learn1:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
  background: Transparent;
  color: white;
```

### Continued development

I will learn more about flexbox, margins, paddings.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me about css flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://flexbox.io/) - This is an amazing article which I will learn more about the flexbox technique. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
